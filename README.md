# **Location Encoding for Machine Learning**

## **Overview**
This repository explores different methods of encoding geospatial data for machine learning applications. It provides a structured approach to **understanding when to use raw latitude and longitude vs. encoding techniques** like **Geohash, H3, Plus Codes, and UTM**. The project also includes an implementation of a **Transformer-based model** for geospatial predictions.
